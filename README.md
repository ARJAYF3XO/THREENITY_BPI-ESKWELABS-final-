This project is hosted on localhost due to the limited resources of the participants. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

This project uses MySQL/MariaDB as its database engine. A pre-configured SQL dump (user_db.sql) is included, which contains the schema and sample data.

We recommend using XAMPP as your local server environment.
